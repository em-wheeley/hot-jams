# hot-jams
This is my  personal repository that displays some  of my assignment work as well as some personal projects, that I apply my experiences in statistics and operations research to new areas. Brief overviews of each of the folders can be seen below. 

## MATH3204-optimisation
In order to effectively run this program, one must first install the python package gurobipy. This package allows for the easy adding of constraints and modelling optimisation problems. There are severla different licenses, however the free one should be sufficient. 

### assignment
This python file is an assignment problem to organising transportation based on several constraints of vaccinisations.

### battleship placement
This python file is a problem that seeks to place battleships on a specific grid, with them doubling up or being obvious. 

## food-planning
Operations is about meal planning, working on basic python code first but might link it up with streamlit interface later

## parkrun-analysis
This is a Rmarkdown file that uses data collated and pre-organised in excel about my own personal running times. Cleaning of data included logical exclusion of outliers, and compatibly formatting dates and times from their original format. The original Rmarkdown script is included, as is a pdf output of this script, for easier visibility.
